# AI Image Transformer

This component allows users to upload images and transform them into different artistic styles using AI techniques.

## Features

- Upload and preview images
- Transform images into various artistic styles:
  - Portrait Sketch
  - Studio Ghibli
  - Anime Style
  - Watercolor Painting
- Download the transformed images

## Implementation Details

The current implementation uses client-side canvas-based transformations to simulate different artistic styles. In a production environment, this would be replaced with actual AI models run on a backend server.

### Components

- **ImageTransformer**: Main component that orchestrates the image transformation workflow
- **ImageUploader**: Handles image uploading, preview, and validation
- **TransformedImage**: Displays and allows downloading of the transformed images
- **StyleSelector**: Provides UI for selecting transformation styles and initiating transformations

### Utilities

- **imageTransformUtils.ts**: Contains transformation styles configuration and simulation functions

## Future Improvements

For a production implementation:

1. **Server-Side Processing**: Replace client-side simulations with:
   - API calls to a backend service running actual AI models
   - Integration with services like Hugging Face Inference API or Replicate

2. **Style Enhancements**:
   - Add more transformation styles
   - Allow custom style parameters (intensity, color adjustments, etc.)

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement image compression before uploading
   - Add caching for frequently used transformations
   - Implement background processing for large images
